# Intorduction

This is small and simple workshop to get VueJS basics you can find at
any corner of the internet. It doesn't contain any exclusive knowledge:
it just shows instant simplicity and power of VueJS and should ignite
you to dive into it more... or not :)

# Prerequirements

To start the journey through the workshop you'll need these packages and
utilities:

* node ^7.0.0
* npm ^3.10.9
* vue-cli ^2.8.1

I presume, you already have node and npm installed on your machine.
Let's install `vue-cli` globally to have command-line tool:

```
npm i -g vue-cli
```

Yup, that's all for this section. See ya in step 1.
